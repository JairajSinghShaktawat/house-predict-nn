# in progress: house-predict-nn

### Overview
Predicting house prices in the Silicon Valley (and possibly generally) using machine learning. I will be investigating linear regression, SVM, and deep learning methods to accurately predict house prices. Emphasis will be placed on gauging the feasibility of neural network models for this problem. A custom neural network implementation based on Sebastian Raska's implementation in "Python Machine Learning" will be refactored to change the output layer from a softmax classifier to a regression node which will sum activation values from a ReLU. 

Data collection and preprocessing will be very important. After obtaining data, preprocessing algorithms will be ran to normalize and scale down the data. Next, feature selection and principal component analysis will be used to obtain the most important features and combine correlated attributes.
