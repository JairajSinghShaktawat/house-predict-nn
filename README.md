# in progress: house-predict-nn

### Overview
Predicting house prices in the Silicon Valley (and possibly generally) using machine learning. I will be investigating linear regression, SVM, and deep learning methods to accurately predict house prices. Data collection and preprocessing will be very important. After obtaining data, preprocessing algorithms will be ran to normalize and scale down the data. Next, feature selection and principal component analysis will be used to obtain the most important features and combine correlated attributes.
